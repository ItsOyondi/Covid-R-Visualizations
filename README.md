# Covid-R-Visualizations
This project provides a visualization of Covid-19 spread on maps and other interactive graphs using plotly package and R-shiny. Guided by Dr. A. 


Dataset source: [Owid Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)
### New dataset about coronavirus was extracted from the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) Coronavirus Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). 
### The Organized CSV files were obtained from [Coronavirus package respostory](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus)

#### The description of the variable names can be obtained from this [repo](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus)

Objectives:
1. To create a map visualization showing the most affected countries, and regions based on the daily reported cases.
2. To visualize the trends of areas that recovered from the pandemic faster as the number of cases reduced.
3. To create an interactive spread map right from the day the first case of Covid-19 was recorded up to date.
